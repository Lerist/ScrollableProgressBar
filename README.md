# ScrollableProgressBar
Provide your users interactive and fun to use progress bar

# What happened?

Everybody hates slowly updating progress bars. As for me, I usually tend to click it or push it with small hope that it will make it move a bit faster. And I always dreamed about a progress bar that will listen to my clicks and drags.

# Introducing BFScrollableProgressBar!

No more boring progress bars! Now you can scroll the progress bar left or right using your track pad! And you can drag it using your mouse cursor in case if you don't have a trackpad. Super fun! Now time will fly faster, slow running operations will finish sooner, just because your users will spend the time playing with the progress bar!
